Decide in THaNeutronDetector::FineProcess which hits are neutrons and
set those hits as "neutrons".

Do I need to have a switch between "Tracks" and "Neutrons"?  Can I
implement both simultaneously?

Need to add "neutrons" to the THaNA class so that they can be compared.


Neutron detectors are counted from the bottom in plane position files.
Does analyzer use same counting?


I am not actually using the list of hit objects.  How do I access that list?
Presumably by calling GetHits.  I think the hits are sorted by plane.
THaScintHit looks not to be called for the Veto array.  For the veto hits, I can
assign ypos to be the center of whichever bar was hit.

What is a hit.
	Element #
	ypos
	TOF
	energy

Get other info from the element number and knowing which planes hit array
is being used.

This document covers the variables found in the database for the BigBite 
spectrometer.  This document assumes the spectrometer is named B, making
the database name db_B.dat.

The formatting of the database goes as
<spectrometer name>.<varname> = <float value>

So, in our case, for the leading momentum calculation coefficient, this 
may be:

B.ciDef = 0.3

The ordering of variables does not matter.

There are three coordinate systems used:

Lab Coordinates - Hall coordinate system where y goes against gravity,
z is in the direction of the beam, and x is to the left when looking
down the beam

Target Coordinates - Origin at the center of the target.  x goes
with gravity, z is parallel to the ground in the direction towards the
center of the BigBite drift chambers.  y is to the left looking down z

Detector Coordinates - Origin specified by center of the first
plane of the drift chambers.  x is "down" in the dispersion direction,
z is in the nominal direction of particles such that z = 0 is defined by
the first plane of the chamber.  y is defined so we have a right handed
coordinate system.

The coordinate system offsets are described in this database.  They are:

B.det_rot_x   How the detector system is rotated around x in target system (degrees)
B.det_rot_y   How the detector system is rotated around y in target system (degrees)
B.det_rot_z   How the detector system is rotated around z in target system (degrees)

Rotations are done in the order of around x, then around the new y, then around
the new z axes.

B.det_x       X offset of target origin and detector origin (m)
B.det_y       Y offset of target origin and detector origin (m)
B.det_z       Z offset of target origin and detector origin (m)

B.target_x    X offset of lab origin and target origin (m)
B.target_y    Y offset of lab origin and target origin (m)
B.target_z    Z offset of lab origin and target origin (m)

Rotations from lab to target are defined by the central theta of BigBite described in
db_run.dat

Tracking Variables:

These variables are relevant to the tracking code and it's performance

B.maxgroups      Soft maximum number of hit groups to consider when doing tracking
                 When the maximum is reached, the tracking code will stop and only use
                 hit groups involving the number of planes it was finding groups for or
                 more, but will not consider fewer planes.  For example, consider the case
                 when we have a maximum of 500.

                 If we have 20 groups of 15 plane combinations, 150 groups of 14 plane 
                 combinations, 700 groups of 13 planes, and 1000 groups of 12 planes, etc.
                 the tracking code will only consider the groups created by 15 planes, 14 planes
                 and 13 planes.

B.hardmaxgroups  Absolute maximum number groups to consider in tracking.  When this limit is
                 reached, no more groups will be considered

B.maxgroupthreshold
                 The code will try and estimate the number of groups that will be found using
                 a maximum allowed plane configuration.  If this number is greater than 
                 maxgroupthreshold, tracking is basically skipped over.  This is a sanity check
                 to prevent the code from grinding on ridiculous number of groups and stalling.

B.minimumplanes  Minimum number of planes to consider when doing tracking.  Warning: The
                 minimum number of planes is 4, however, reducing the number greatly 
                 increases the number of hit groups must be considered to the point where
                 performance may be crippled.  Increasing this number will improve performance.


These variables are relevant to finding vertices and momentum in the tracking code:

B.target_length  The absolute length of the target (m)

B.effbendx       The x position of the center of the effective bending plane in 
		 target coords (m)

B.effbendy       The y position of the center of the effective bending plane in 
		 target coords (m)

B.effbendz       The z position of the center of the effective bending plane in 
		 target coords (m)

B.effbendplanetheta
                 The orientation of the bending plane (degrees)  This is nominally
                 +10 degrees

The formula for the momentum is given by:
    p = ciDef/(deflection angle) + ciDefXbend*bend_x/(deflection_angle) + cThetaTarg * atan(theta_target) +
        + cY * detector_y + cPhi * detector_yp

B.ciDef             Coefficient for inverse deflection angle (GeV*rad/c)
B.ciDefXbend        Coefficient for bend plane x intercept (m, detector coords)/ deflection angle (GeV*rad/(m*c))
B.cThetaTarg        Coefficient for theta in target coordiante system in radians (GeV/(rad*c))
B.cY                Coefficient for y (m, detector coords, z_detector = 0) (GeV/(m*c))
B.cPhi              Coefficient for y' (tangent, detector coords) (GeV/c)

The formula for the vertex reconstruction is done by creating a leading term, which
is done by assuming that there is no deflection in the non-dispersive (horizontal) direction,
finding the intercept with the beam, and defining that as a point.  The vertex is
described in the HALL coordinate system.  We let x_hall and y_hall be defined by this point.
For z_hall, we allow for first order corrections.  The formula is:

vertex_z_hall = cV*z0 + cVX*track_x + cVXp*track_xp + cVY*track_y + cVyp*track_yp

B.cV		 Coefficient for leading term, z0 (m), found as described above
B.cVX		 Coefficient for first order correction in track x intercept at z = 0, all in m and detector coordinate system
B.cVXp		 Coefficient for first order correction in track x', in tangents and detector coordinate system
B.cVY		 Coefficient for first order correction in track y intercept at z = 0, all in m and detector coordinate system
B.cVYp		 Coefficient for first order correction in track y', in tangetns and detector coordinate system

These variables are relevant to shower cuts:

B.useshowercuts  Set to 1 to use shower cuts.  0 to not

B.targetxext     Target window x extension (m).  This is the size of the window that will
                 be above and below the two extreme x points of the target

B.targetyext     Target window y extension (m).  This is the size of the window that will
                 be above and below the two extreme y points of the target

B.targetwindowxoffset
                 X offset for target window (m).  This will raise or lower the absolute
                 position of the target shower cut window

B.showerxext     The half width of the shower window in the x direction (m)

B.showeryext     The half width of the shower window in the y direction (m)

B.3rdchamxext    The half width of the third chamber window in the x direction (m)

B.3rdchamyext    The half width of the third chamber window in the y direction (m)

B.thirdchamminz  The minimum z value the center of a plane can have to be considered
                 a part of the third chamber
